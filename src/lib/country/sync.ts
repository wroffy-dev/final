/**
 * Copying the default market's content into another market.
 *
 * ## Add-only, and why that is the whole design
 *
 * This **adds content a market has never had**. It is not a mirror, and the
 * difference matters more than anything else here: a mirror makes the
 * destination look like the source, which means deleting what the source no
 * longer has and overwriting what the destination has changed. Both of those
 * destroy a market's own decisions.
 *
 * So there are exactly three outcomes per item: create it, skip it because the
 * market already has it, or skip it because the market *had* it and removed it.
 * Nothing is ever updated, and nothing is ever deleted. Source state is never a
 * reason to touch the destination — deleting a page in India does not touch the
 * copy in the UAE, and never will.
 *
 * ## Tombstones
 *
 * `CountrySyncMapping` deliberately has no foreign key to the row it points at,
 * so deleting the copy leaves the mapping standing. That mapping is the only
 * evidence the market once had the item and chose to remove it. Without it the
 * next run would see "missing", helpfully recreate it, and undo a deliberate
 * removal every single time somebody pressed the button.
 *
 * ## What is copied, and what turns out not to need copying
 *
 * Pages, their sections and market-specific forms are genuinely per-market, so
 * they are copied. Categories, brands and products are **shared rows** — one
 * "Cloud storage", one Dropbox, one product — so what a market needs is not a
 * duplicate but an availability record saying it offers them. That is what gets
 * created.
 *
 * ## The allowlist
 *
 * Only the entity kinds below are ever touched, as an explicit list rather than
 * "everything except…". The exclusions — blogs, leads, submissions, consent
 * records, users, permissions, credentials, audit logs, backups and the source
 * market's own settings — must not depend on somebody remembering to add a new
 * model to a deny-list.
 *
 * ## Money
 *
 * Prices are **not** copied. India's ₹1,250 is not 1,250 of anything else, and
 * writing it into a row labelled AED would relabel a value rather than convert
 * it. The destination row is created in the destination's own currency with its
 * prices left empty, and reported as needing localisation — an empty price an
 * administrator must fill in is safe; a wrong one that looks filled in is not.
 */

 * The entity list, labels, outcome and result shapes live in `sync-entities.ts`
