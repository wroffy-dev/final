/**
 * The site's one robots.txt.
 *
 * Crawlers read robots.txt from the **host root only**. `/ae/robots.txt` is not
 * a file a crawler will ever fetch, so a market does not get its own — its
 * rules are compiled into the single root file, each path written with that
 * market's prefix. Presenting a per-market robots.txt in the admin would be
 * offering a control that does nothing.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately kept apart, because conflating them is the most
 * common way a site disappears from search:
 *
 *  - **Disallow** stops a crawler *fetching* a URL.
 *  - **noindex** asks it not to *list* one.
 *
 * A URL that is disallowed is never fetched, so its noindex is never seen — and
 * it can still be listed from other signals. Blocking crawling to hide a page
 * does the opposite of what it looks like. The admin says so beside the field.
 *
 * robots.txt is also not access control. It is public, and it is advisory.
 * Anything that must not be reached is protected by authentication; this file
 * never lists such a path, because listing it would publish its address.
