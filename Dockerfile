# transitive modules (@prisma/config -> effect -> fast-check -> ...), so each
# missing one surfaced as the next `Cannot find module` at container start and
# was patched by adding one more COPY. Copying a real install ends that cycle

# /data/uploads is the media library. It is outside /app on purpose: everything
# under /app is replaced wholesale by the next image, so a library written
# there is destroyed by the deployment that was supposed to keep it. Mounted as
# a persistent volume it survives restarts, rebuilds and redeployments — on a
# VPS, in Docker Compose, on Coolify, and on Azure Container Apps with an Azure
# Files share mounted at this path. The application never learns which of those
# it is; it writes to a directory.
#
# Ownership is set here, at build time, because the container does not run as
# root: a volume mounted over a directory the `nextjs` user cannot write to
# produces an EACCES on the first upload and nothing else.
#
# Azure Container Apps without a mounted share is the one case that does not
# work — its filesystem is ephemeral and replicas do not share it, so a file
# written by one replica is invisible to the others and gone on the next
# revision. See docs/MEDIA-STORAGE.md.
